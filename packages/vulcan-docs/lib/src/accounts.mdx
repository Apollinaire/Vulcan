title: Accounts
---

The `vulcan:accounts` package provides a component and Meteor methods to handle accounts-related operations. It is based on `std:accounts-ui`.

## Quickstart

The component registered by this package is called `AccountsLoginForm`. To use it, call `<Components.AccountsLoginForm />` in any React component. You will need to add the `accounts-password` meteor package, and you will have authentication with username, email and password enabled.

## Signup/Login methods

To enable signup with email/password, you must add the meteor package `accounts-password`: 
You can also add signup/login via Google, Twitter, Facebook or github. 

```sh
# pick one or more of the below
meteor add accounts-password
meteor add accounts-facebook
meteor add accounts-google
meteor add accounts-github
meteor add accounts-twitter
```

To setup the third-party authentication, you will need to add the API configuration to your `settings.json` file. Be careful to **not** put this in your public settings. Once you have added the packages and the settings related to it, you should see the login button add automatically to the `AccountsLoginForm` component.

Here is an example of settings for every supported provider:

```json
{
  "oAuth": {
    "twitter": {
      "consumerKey": "foo",
      "secret": "bar"
    },
    "facebook": {
      "appId": "foo",
      "secret": "bar"
    },
    "google": {
      "clientId": "foo",
      "secret": "bar"
    },
    "github": {
      "clientId": "foo",
      "secret": "bar"
    },
  }
}
```

## Customize the component

By default, `AccountsLoginForm` will show a login form, along with a button to switch to signup and a button to switch to a 'forgotten password' form. To change this, we expose the following API:

Name | Type | Default | Description
----- | ---- | -------- | -----------
showSignInLink | `boolean` | `true` | show a link to switch to signin
showSignUpLink | `boolean` | `true` | show a link to switch to signup
